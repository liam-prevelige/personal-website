                                <h3>Chair of Student Leadership Board:<br>Magnuson Center for Entrepreneurship</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Collectively, the student leadership board for Dartmouth's <a href="https://magnuson.dartmouth.edu/">Magnuson Center for 
                                    Entrepreneurship</a>, the center for entrepreneurial programming at Dartmouth, organizes 
                                    student entrepreneurship activities and workshops, draws student interest to venture 
                                    capital, engages with Dartmouth alumni in the innovation space, connects to other 
                                    universities' entrepreneuriship centers, and provides resources for promising Dartmouth startups. 
                                    Although numbers vary year-to-year, there are currently 16 students on the leadership board - including 
                                    undergraduate, masters, and PhD students.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I have been a part of the student leadership board since freshman year. Before becoming chair (the 
                                    board's leader) in January 2020, I served as the head of the student outreach team, which 
                                    involved featuring a number of student startups to the larger Dartmouth community, designing and 
                                    sharing marketing content for upcoming events, and growing our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/magnusoncenterstudents/">social media pages</a> from less than 
                                    300 followers to over 1,200. In addition, I served as the leader for the venture capital team, 
                                    which required organizing the <a href="https://www.vcic.org/">Venture Capital Investment Competition</a> Workshops and a regional competition, 
                                    and worked on the events team, which required organizing events with guest speakers, including a panel 
                                    discussion with alumni of <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> and moderating a discussion with <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/geoff-ralston">Y Combinator President Geoff 
                                    Ralston</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As chair of the board, I manage the other leaders, determine the direction of the Magnuson Center's future 
                                    programming and <a href="https://magnuson.dartmouth.edu/magnuson-center-campus-ventures/">development of the MCCV startup recruiting platform</a>, 
                                    and work with the center's Alumni Board as our student representative. I also cover miscellaneous 
                                    responsibilities; for example, I recently discussed entrepreneurial expansion strategies with Trinity College's president, 
                                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanne_Berger-Sweeney">Joanne Berger-Sweeney</a>, and other administrators.

                                <p>
                                    As treasurer of the local fraternity Chi Gamma Epsilon, I am responsible for the 
                                    active management of $450,000 in annual income. Since we have no national organization and 
                                    the house's advisors have a hands-off approach to operational management, I am solely responsible 
                                    for overseeing day-to-day expenses, bills, long-term savings, working with Dartmouth administration, 
                                    and filing taxes and related forms. Since taking on this role in the summer of 2021, I have saved the 
                                    house over $30,000 while funding and leading a number of new house improvement projects. I also 
                                    recently designed a new sales structure for our fraternity-owned parking lot, increasing quarterly 
                                    income by $20,000. I'm also in the process of creating an investment structure for our long-term 
                                    savings fund, which has grown from $27,000 to $57,000 after years of financial struggles, and 
                                    designing new methods of ensuring the fraternities long-term security, like removing student 
                                    access to the long-term fund I've helped create.

                                    In addition to my role's core responsibilities, I play a key role as one of ten voting members on 
                                    the executive board and actively explore methods of improving the fraternity's commitment to 
                                    positive values and community improvement. This includes the promotion and successful implementation 
                                    of mandatory philanthropy work for all members of the fraternity and onboarding a new executive position 
                                    that promotes discussion around mental health and upholding of the house's core motto: Come As You Are.

                                <p>
                                    The <a href="https://www.vcic.org/">Venture Capital Investment Competition (VCIC)</a> is a global intercollegiate 
                                    competition in which students are judged on their ability to analyze 3 real startups seeking funding 
                                    and pitch an investment strategy to a panel of venture capitalists. I competed on Dartmouth's first and 
                                    second undergraduate VCIC team, <a href="https://magnuson.dartmouth.edu/blog/2020/02/12/vcic/">placing 1st</a> and 
                                    <a href="https://magnuson.dartmouth.edu/vcic-2021/">2nd</a> in the 
                                    Boston Regional Competition in winter of 2020 and 2021 
                                    respectively. Check out our deliverables for the <a href="files/vcic-2020-deliverable.pdf">2020 final investment proposition</a> 
                                    and <a href="files/vcic-2021-deliverable.pdf">2021 final investment proposition</a>.

                                    The competition is preceded by an intense series of workshops in which 25 students, selected from ~60 applicants, 
                                    are trained on the principles of venture capital by the Executive Director of Private Equity and Venture Capital 
                                    of Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, <a href="https://www.crosslinkcapital.com/team/jim-feuille/">Jim Feuille</a>. During 
                                    the fall and winter workshops - which consist of a slightly modified version of Tuck's MBA course on venture capital - the 25 students are 
                                    narrowed down to 6 for the final team.

                                    Since my time competing on the two teams, I have helped organize and judge the VCIC workshops, an internal competition, 
                                    and a new <a href="https://magnuson.dartmouth.edu/blog/2021/02/24/vcic-competition-spring-2021/">Northeast Regional Competition</a> 
                                    hosted by Dartmouth. At the Northeast Regional Competition, I moderated a conversation with keynote speaker Geoff Ralston, president of Y Combinator.

                                    During my studies at Dartmouth, I've had the opportunity to conduct in-depth economics 
                                    research. I'll focus on two in particular: (1) an econometric analysis of the relationship between 
                                    employment and alcohol consumption and (2) macroeconomic advice for Uruguay.

                                    Using STATA and data from the National Longitudal Survey of Youth, I worked with a team to 
                                    use a difference-in-differences model and 2-stage least squares regression with a dummy exogenous 
                                    variable - state excise tax rates - to explore the effects of alcohol consumption on employment. Surprisingly, our estimates 
                                    suggested that individuals with lowered alcohol consumption experience no statistically significant 
                                    increase in employment. Check out <a href="files/econ-research-paper.pdf">the paper we wrote</a> for

                                    In another economics research project, myself and a teammate explore the economy of Uruguay  
                                    and present advice for economic growth, monetary policy, and fiscal policy, with support. Check

                                <p>
                                    In high school, I started a number of small businesses, some of which I continue working on today. 
                                    My first business was taking care of people's animals; since my parents wouldn't allow my siblings and 
                                    I to get a pet, I found a loophole to satisfy my love of animals - while still being parent-approved: starting 
                                    a company called CritterCare. I had over 20 paying clients, constantly traveling to people's houses to take 
                                    care of their pets or filling our house with dogs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In addition to CritterCare, I started a 3D printing business, tutoring service for classes and standardized testing, 
                                    a clothing resale business, and frequently attended tag sales on weekends to find stuff to list on eBay (one of 
                                    my tag sale partners-in-crime is featured in the bottom left with a good looking fur coat). For my 3D 
                                    printing business, I sold plastic versions of decorative automotive parts for collectors' cars and motorcycles; the 
                                    original parts were either no longer available or ridiculously expensive. One of my most popular items was a plastic 
                                    cap for the shocks of the 1983 Honda CB1100F motorcycle, which more than paid for all of my printer expenses alone. I also ran 
                                    a tutoring business with a few friends from high school - to this day, I ocassionally Zoom past clients that are still 
                                    looking for help. My last semi-formal business was reselling high demand clothing, like Supreme. Although I 
                                    didn't wear the clothing myself, I recruited 7 people, telling them what and when to buy (the targeted items 
                                    often sold out in under 20 seconds after release). Then, they would ship the items to my house and we would split 
                                    the profits from resale 50-50 (market prices were significantly higher than retail, since the items were hard to get).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Although I don't have an exact number, I've probably made $10,000-$15,000 from these businesses, all of which were started 
                                    throughout high school.

                                <h3>Program Leader:<br>SafeRides of Redding and Easton</h3>
                                <p>
                                    In my hometown, a number of my peers were in serious drunk driving accidents, resulting in 
                                    brain damage, paralysis, and other severe injuries. As a result, a two-town SafeRides program,
                                    which offered free rides from student volunteers 10:00pm-2:00am on Friday & Saturday, was established. 
                                    I took on the role of program leader. I recruited over 100 student volunteers for 10 teams on the weekend, 
                                    in addition to parents and administrators to supervise each night. This was a massive operation, requiring me to  
                                    get support from the police department, town administration, a sponsorship from Key Club, and connections to 
                                    leaders of neighboring SafeRides organizations - none of which were student-run.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In addition to taking on this large organizational responsibility, I raised $7,000 to support a phone, food, and 
                                    other necessities. Most of this money was raised by getting local businesses to sponsor SafeRides in return for their logo being printed 
                                    on our T-shirts.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Ultimately, hundreds of rides were given that year, hundreds of members from the community actively supported 
                                    the program, and, for the first time in years, there were no student drunk driving accidents. After graduating from high school, I passed the organization 
                                    to several students & parents - the program <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/SafeRidesofReddingandEaston/">remains in operation today</a>.

                                    In my first two years at Dartmouth, I was a member of the venture capital team for the 
                                    Dartmouth Finance Society. Each week, we worked in a team of 6-7 to prepare a presentation 
                                    on recent updates in the venture capital space. These updates were shared to all club  
                                    members - approximately 60 other students - in an oral presentation, followed by Q&A.

                                    In addition to this exploration of venture capital, notable alumni working in finance would 
                                    often join meetings to share their experiences and discuss new opportunities. This served as 
                                    the foundation for my interest in venture capital and understanding the perspective of an investor, 
                                    as opposed to the entrepreneur.

                                    simulator, there were significant written deliverables on the design and engineering process:
