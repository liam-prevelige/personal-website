                                <p>
                                    PreSell is an e-commerce Android application that I've been building entirely on my own;
                                    it's certainly my largest independent project to date. After noticing how expensive merchandise 
                                    with custom designs are - despite designers earning small margins on each sale - I decided to 
                                    make my own marketplace. The app enables sellers to upload their unique designs onto the marketplace in a 
                                    few clicks, selecting which types of goods (i.e. mugs, coasters, stickers, etc.) they'd like to 
                                    sell with their design. All users can then explore and purchase these items in the feed. The purchasing
                                    process is unique; a sliding bar indicates the price the buyer would like to pay, with lower prices
                                    taking longer to sell/ship and higher prices selling immediately. A sale is made at the lower price point 
                                    when enough other users request the item at the same or lower price point, reducing the item's unit cost. 
                                    Although I still have more development to do before the app is available to the market (and sales can be made),
                                    I have sourced manufacturers and built the vast majority of the application, including the payments system (see below).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This has been an extremely fun, educational, and long project - I've been working on it off and on for a year and half. 
                                    Since this app is built for Android, most of the code is written in Java. In total, there are 11 activities, 6 adapters, 
                                    10 fragments, 6 models, 6 other utilities, 40 layouts, and 6 menus. I host the database on Google Firebase and use 
                                    Google's authentication, realtime database, storage, machine learning, and cloud functions. The payments system is 
                                    handled via Stripe Connect; a Stripe account is created for a user when they sign up and placing orders is handled by 
                                    a remote server and cloud functions. To maintain security, all financial information and payments processing is conducted 
                                    through Stripe. Images are cached and loaded with Glide.

                                <p>
                                    I am one of a few undergraduates helping to conduct research in Dartmouth's 
                                    <a href="https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/home/">Reality and Robotics Lab</a>. 
                                    My contributions are centered around a project supported by 
                                    <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/epscor/">EPSCoR</a>, in which 
                                    multirobot systems are used to detect toxic algae blooms before they cause 
                                    any damage.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Using the ROS framework, I am working on the communication system between 
                                    sensor readings and robotic movements for the Catabot 2. Given a simulated
                                    environment of Lake Sunapee and mappings of biomarkers, the Catabot must move 
                                    and ultimately trace concentrated areas for future algae blooms. Although I'm 
                                    still working on this project, I have been exposed to new tools for simulation, 
                                    navigation, and data processing (i.e. Gazebo, QGroundControl, Python processing tools, and more). 
                                    This research has also served as a foundation for other work, like the multirobot 
                                    patrol system described below. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This research has also exposed me to incredible professors and graduate students; the 
                                    project is conducted with a team from six institutions: Dartmouth, University of New Hampshire,
                                    Bates, University of Rhode Island, and University of South Carolina. Reading groups on modern 
                                    multirobot robotics research helps to expand these interactions beyond the immediate project.

                                <p>
                                    As one of two undergraduates in an upper level robotics course, I had the opportunity to 
                                    pursue a loosely structured, research-oriented multirobot project. My teammate and I  
                                    developed an intelligent patrolling system to detect robots escaping from a confined area. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    My teammate and I developed a learning algorithm that adjusted the speed of patrolling robots 
                                    as they detected escapees. The patrolling region is subdivided into a grid, with each cell containing 
                                    a desired patroller velocity. Confined robots choose a random time and target exit (weighted by distance). 
                                    If a patroller catches a robot escaping, the simulation pauses and the escapee returns to its starting location, 
                                    while corresponding regions of the grid are updated according to our algorithm.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I used Docker to execute the Stage simulations in a Linux environment. Separate nodes, written in Python, exist for the patrollers, 
                                    confined robots, and a 'security' system, which handles simulation metadata. The algorithm 
                                    we developed improved detection up to 400%. We also 
                                    wrote a formal research paper describing related work, the algorithm, simulation environment, and results, which can be

                                <p>
                                    Two friends and I started a freelance software development company to improve efficiency 
                                    at large companies using automated data processing. Below I discuss two successful projects 
                                    that I led in development.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A government worker came to us regarding potential automation for processing military contracts, which 
                                    his team was responsible for handling over the coming months. I designed and developed the majority of a project 
                                    in Python, with tools including Pandas for excel work and HTTP requests in sessions for scraping. As a 
                                    result, months of labor was reduced to minutes - that is, the time to configure the program and collect 
                                    the output.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Another company, Connect Healthcare Collaboration, was having difficulty sourcing contact information for a 
                                    large pipeline of potential customers. The solution I initially designed was overly complex; the Python-based 
                                    project set up emails, linked a number of aliases to each, then used Selenium to set up accounts on RocketReach.io, 
                                    using their free accounts and the RocketReach API to access individual client contact information. Ultimately, I redesigned 
                                    the solution to scrape and fill in company-specific contact information while outputting the result with Pandas, removing 
                                    the need for a complex system using email aliases and Selenium.

                                    the world's largest startup accelerator, has relied heavily on my technical knowledge of computer science 
                                    and the intersection of my interests in software development and entrepreneurship. I collaborate with a 
                                    network students from 70 universities, each of which has two representatives who were selected by 
                                    the Plug and Play investment committee.

                                    Nearly every week, I evaluate 25 startups seeking an investment. I heavily depend on my background in computer science 
                                    to determine the feasability, defensibility, and development timeline for their technology. For example, my most 
                                    recent analysis was on a company providing a digital marketplace to trade datasets and a platform to train, host,  
                                    and deploy niche machine learning algorithms. I presented my analysis to Plug and Play Tech Center's investment 
                                    committee, the PDF of which can be viewed <a href="files/pnp-alpine-intuition-dd.pdf">here</a> (although note 
                                    that most of the analysis is presented orally, not written).

                                <p>
                                    Taking the lead in a team of three, I helped develop the "Nuggets" game server; players explore 
                                    a set of rooms and passageways in search of gold nuggets with lifelike visibility limitations. 
                                    The rooms and passages are defined by a map loaded by the server at the start of the game and gold 
                                    nuggets are randomly distributed in piles within the rooms. Up to 26 players, with one spectator, 
                                    may play a given game. After being randomly dropped in a room at the start of the game, players move about, 
                                    collecting nuggets when they move onto a pile. When all gold nuggets are collected, the game ends and a 
                                    summary is printed.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The code for this game's server is written in C and we used the Scrum project management methodology to organize 
                                    the development process. By the time of completion, we had over 30 sprints and more than 300 commits to our  
                                    git repository. In addition to taking a leadership role with the Scrum project management, I developed the infrastructure 
                                    for the game's display and storage of the map, calculating a player's visibility, managing movement, collecting gold, 
                                    conducting extensive unit and system testing, and creating documentation for design, implementation, and testing.

                                    Using Logisim, I built out a Y86 simulator and microarchitecture starting from basic logic gates. This includes 
                                    determining microcode for the finite state machine and wiring an arithmetic logic unit, RAM, register reader, 
                                    register writer, finite state machine, microsequencer, input/output, and program counter while properly piecing each of 
                                    these components together. To the right I have added a photo of the abstracted microarchitecture; this Y86 simulator 
                                    uses Harvard architecture, although the transition to Von Neumann is fairly straightforward.

                                    I developed a fitness Android application that tracks and stores a user's exercise 
                                    information, including the path taken in the trip, the speed of the user, and other 
                                    relevant information while storing the exercise data in an easily accessible panel. 
                                    When set to 'automatic,' the application uses Google's machine learning 
                                    API to automatically identify the type of exercise being undergone. Users can adjust 
                                    different settings in the app, like units for their exercise. This app includes 6 activities, 
                                    3 adapters, 3 fragments, 4 models, a tracking service, 3 utility classes, 12 layouts, and 
                                    5 menus.

                                <h3>Cancer Screening Classifier</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Using MATLAB, I built a classifier to pre-screen patients for risk of ovarian cancer. The 
                                    program builds a model based off of a set of training data, which consists of labeled 
                                    spectrometry results divided by patients known to have ovarian cancer and known to not have it. 
                                    The program takes the mean of spectra information from the training data for each group, averaging 
                                    them out and storing the between-class mean. A scatter matrix is then computed within the class and 
                                    between classes, allowing for the computation of the maximum generalized eigenvectors and the creation 
                                    of a classification model to be applied to the test dataset. Based on the dataset I was given, the 
                                    classifier was about 93% accurate in both the training and testing data, suggesting the classifier 
                                    and corresponding eigenvector can be applied pretty generally; the ROC curves in training and testing 
                                    were similar, so there is clearly consistency in spectra results among patients with and without 
                                    ovarian cancer.
                                </p>

                                    This project served as my introduction to classification models and applied computer science. To the left 
                                    I have posted the ROC curves for training and testing respectively, as well as histograms for testing and 
                                    training with averaged spectra results for those classified with and without ovarian cancer. Note that, at 
                                    some thresholds, the histograms overlap, indicating the classifier would fail in these cases.

                                    Since seeing viral videos of 'trick shots' - some of which seem too good to be true - 
                                    I've always been interested in how to validate or invalidate their authenticity. For this 
                                    project, I used MATLAB to write a program that can analyze videos of, say, a ball's trajectory, 
                                    and determine the expected ballistic motion.
                                </p>

                                    A user selects the center of the traveling ball in selected video frames. Then, four types of 
                                    least-squares estimations are run and the best fitting regression is selected. The predicted points 
                                    are then overlayed on the frame. I've given examples of the output in the picture to the right, with the 
                                    graph displaying the compiled estimations. The program also outputs the error for each regression.

                                    fun but probably aren't intensive enough to require their own section. Below I've 
                                    listed a few highlights!
                                </p>

                                    In MATLAB, I wrote a program that removes distortion in an image of a flat planar 
                                    surface. In short, I estimate a homography that describes the projection of a 
                                    planar surface from the 3D world to the 2D image camera sensor, then apply the 
                                    inverse homography to an image. I love the visual of the license plate - 
                                    the second image is the output of my program, removing distortion and 
                                    allowing you to clearly make out the letters from an otherwise unreadable image.

                                    In another project, I used Python to write the 'Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon' game. If 
                                    you're not familiar with this game, you choose a random actor/actress and see how many 
                                    degrees of separation they lie from Kevin Bacon; i.e. Actor A was in Movie X with Actor B, 
                                    and Actor B was in Movie Y with Kevin Bacon, so Actor A is two degrees of separation from 
                                    Kevin Bacon. With my program, you can also reset the universe around a different actor.
                                </p>

                                    Although the list could go on, the final project I'll talk about was a challenge problem from 
                                    my Algorithms class. Given a string s[1:n] and a dictionary D(), we needed to quickly determine 
                                    all possible ways of reconstituting the string with anagrams and return the corresponding list. 
                                    So, running the program on 'dynamic,' the output is 13 possible anagrams and the list is 
                                    [’cyma din’, ’cyma nid’, ’cad miny’, ’cany dim’,’cany mid’, ’cyan dim’,’cyan mid’, ’many cid’,’myna cid’, 
                                    ’cay mind’, ’damn icy’, ’mand icy’, ’dynamic’]. This generally takes a lot of time, but I came up 
                                    with an optimal dynamic programming algorithm: (1) represent the dictionary as a map with key = character 
                                    frequency : value = list of original words, (2) dynamically take permutations of the string, (3) compare 
                                    permutations with dictionary keys, adding original words to list if they exist.
